    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  </header>

  <div class="container">
    <div class="faq-section">
      <h3>Is this program legal and secure?</h3>
      <p>Yes. We work within legal frameworks, use contracts, and partner with licensed attorneys and escrow services to ensure all parties are protected.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-section">
      <h3>How does a Personal Guarantor (PG) earn money?</h3>
      <p>Once your credit profile is matched with a vetted business and the funding is approved, you are paid up to $10,000 via escrow.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-section">
      <h3>Do I need to pay anything up front?</h3>
      <p>No. There is no upfront fee required to participate as a PG. The process is free to apply and be evaluated.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-section">
      <h3>Will this affect my credit?</h3>
      <p>Your credit report may show an inquiry, but there are no late payments, new lines, or revolving balances involved. Risk is minimal.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-section">
      <h3>Is my name removed after 12 months?</h3>
      <p>We work with legal counsel to ensure you are formally released from your PG obligation once the timeline or terms are fulfilled.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-section">
      <h3>What if the business defaults?</h3>
      <p>Funds are managed through escrow, and the business cannot access more than 10% of the funds until you are paid. Legal safeguards are in place to protect you.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-section">
      <h3>Is this a loan or debt?</h3>
      <p>No. Acting as a personal guarantor does not mean you are borrowing or repaying money. You are not responsible for payments unless a default occurs under the agreement.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-section">
      <h3>Who can apply to be a PG?</h3>
      <p>Anyone with a 750+ FICO score, low utilization, clean credit history, and strong financials may qualify. We screen all applicants thoroughly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-section">
      <h3>What types of businesses are supported?</h3>
      <p>We only support registered U.S.-based C-Corporations that pass vetting. No sole proprietors or individuals.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-section">
      <h3>How long does it take to match with a business?</h3>
      <p>It can take 1–4 weeks depending on your credit profile and availability of vetted businesses seeking a PG.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-section">
      <h3>Why do you need people with 750+ credit scores?</h3>
      <p>Businesses often need a personal guarantor to strengthen their application for funding. Lenders are more likely to approve applications backed by a strong credit profile.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-section">
      <h3>How soon will I get paid?</h3>
      <p>Once the business receives funding and all agreements are signed, you receive your payment — usually within 7–14 days via escrow.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-section">
      <h3>Can I do this more than once?</h3>
      <p>Yes. If your initial PG transaction is successful, you may be eligible to act as a guarantor again for future businesses — increasing your total earnings.</p>
