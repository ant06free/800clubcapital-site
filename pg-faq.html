    <h3>What is a Personal Guarantor?</h3>
    <p>You allow your credit profile to support a business’s loan application — you are not co-signing or borrowing money yourself. It’s a credit enhancement tool.</p>

    <h3>Is this legal and safe?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Everything is governed by legal contracts. Escrow ensures payouts and liabilities are handled properly.</p>

    <h3>Do I take on any financial risk?</h3>
    <p>You’re not responsible for paying the loan, but your name is listed as PG. Legal protections, vetting, and funding limits are built to reduce risk.</p>

    <h3>How do I get paid?</h3>
    <p>You receive up to $10,000 via escrow after the business is funded. Payouts typically occur within 7–14 business days.</p>

    <h3>What if the business defaults?</h3>
    <p>You're not responsible for repayment. Escrow limits exposure and only releases funds once you’re paid. Legal steps protect all parties.</p>

    <h3>How long am I listed as PG?</h3>
    <p>Standard is 12 months. We work with businesses to refinance or release you early if possible.</p>

    <h3>Can I do this more than once?</h3>
    <p>Yes. If your first experience goes well, you're eligible to repeat the process and earn again with new businesses.</p>

    <h3>Will this affect my credit score?</h3>
    <p>Your report may show a soft or hard inquiry, but no new balances or revolving debt are reported under your name.</p>

    <h3>Who qualifies to become a PG?</h3>
    <p>Minimum requirements include:
      <ul>
        <li>FICO 750+</li>
        <li>Low utilization</li>
        <li>No late payments or derogatory marks</li>
        <li>5+ open tradelines</li>
        <li>Annual income of $70K+</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Why do businesses need a PG?</h3>
    <p>Many businesses don’t have a strong credit profile. A PG helps them qualify for working capital to grow, while you earn for providing that credit strength.</p>
